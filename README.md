## Goal
You must write a program that draws a wireframe model of a teapot

## Notes
* Edges of the triangles drawn by filling in pixels (50 marks for UG4 students, 40 marks for MSc students). You will receive these marks even you simply interpolate the two points of the edges and cast the sampled floating point coordinates to integers.
* A short README file reporting what you have done (10 marks).
* An evidence that the program runs (10 marks).

## Extra
* Complex / efficient algorithms to draw the lines (better marks for midpoint algorithm, antialised lines).
* Applying homogeneous transformations (translation/rotation/scaling) to the teapot.
* Perspective transformation.
* Interactive control of the teapot, etc
* Comparison of different techniques.
* But I will not give extra marks for shading, hidden surface removals, etc, because that is going to be the next assignment.
