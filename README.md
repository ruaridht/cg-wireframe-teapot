Implementations of various line drawing algorithms used to render the Utah Teapot as well as various transformations.

README.txt goes into more depth.

### Features ###
Line Drawing
* Midpoint (Bresenhams) line algorithm
* DDA Line algorithm
* Xiaolin Wu patterns
* Gupta-Sproull algorithm
* AAL (Anti-aliased line, bresenham variant)
* EFLA (Extremely Fast Line Algorithm -  http://www.edepot.com/algorithm.html)

Transformations
* Scale the object.
* Rotate along the x,y,z axis.
* Translate along the x,y,z axis.
* Shear along the x,y axis (for simplicity).
